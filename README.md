This repository contains work on a machine learning model for time series prediction that I created during my PhD in the Space and Planetary Science group at Lancaster University. 

I created it to predict the solar wind conditions at Mars for periods when spacecraft can not directly measure them. It could also be applied to other planets or comets. If you'd like to use this model and are having issues, please contact me at sofi.durward@yahoo.co.uk and I'll do my best to help.
